This is the script for COVID-19.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

covid_df <- read_csv("covid19.csv")

dim(covid_df)
vector_cols <- colnames(covid_df)
vector_cols #represents a vector

head(covid_df)
covid_df_all_states <- covid_df %>% filter(Province_State == "All States") %>% select(-Province_State)

covid_df_all_states_daily <- covid_df_all_states %>% select(Date, Country_Region, active, hospitalizedCurr, daily_tested, daily_positive)

```

```{r}
covid_df_all_states_daily_sum <- covid_df_all_states_daily %>% group_by(Country_Region) %>% summarise(tested = sum(daily_tested), positive = sum(daily_positive), active = sum(active), hospitalized = sum(hospitalizedCurr)) %>% arrange(-tested)

covid_top_10 <- head(covid_df_all_states_daily_sum, 10)
```
